# MetaHarness: legal vertical

A ready-made Claude Code harness for drafting contract redlines, sanity-checking citations, and producing first-pass risk ratings. Scaffolds a multi-agent setup wired for legal review workflows: an intake agent that reads the document, a redline drafter, a citation/authority checker, and a risk rater that classifies clauses by severity. Aimed at legal-ops teams, in-house counsel, and lawtech builders who want a working starting point instead of a blank repo. This is a drafting aid — it does not give legal advice, does not replace attorney review, and every output is meant to be checked by a qualified human before it leaves your office.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx @metaharness/legal@latest my-bot
cd my-bot && npm install && harness doctor
```

`harness doctor` verifies your Claude Code install, MCP server wiring, and agent tier routing. Once it reports green, point Claude Code at the folder and start dropping contracts into `inputs/`.

## What you get

- `agents/intake.md` — document parser and clause extractor (haiku tier)
- `agents/redliner.md` — produces tracked-change style edits with rationale (sonnet tier)
- `agents/citation-checker.md` — verifies cited statutes, cases, and cross-references (sonnet tier)
- `agents/risk-rater.md` — classifies clauses as low / medium / high / blocker with reasoning (opus tier)
- `agents/reviewer.md` — synthesizes the three streams into a single review packet (opus tier)
- `.claude/settings.json` preconfigured with tier routing, redaction hooks, and an `inputs/` + `outputs/` workspace
- MCP servers wired for filesystem access to the contract folder and a memory store scoped to the matter
- `CLAUDE.md` with the drafting-only guardrails, citation-format rules, and the "always flag, never decide" review protocol

## Advanced

Run the built-in health check:

```bash
$ harness doctor
[ok] claude-code >= 1.0
[ok] agents/ (5 files)
[ok] MCP: filesystem (inputs/, outputs/)
[ok] MCP: memory (matter-scoped)
[ok] tier routing: haiku=1 sonnet=2 opus=2
```

Validate the agent and settings files before committing changes:

```bash
$ harness validate
[ok] .claude/settings.json schema
[ok] 5 agents parsed
[ok] CLAUDE.md guardrails present
```

Run headlessly against a single contract for batch review:

```bash
claude -p --plugin-dir my-bot \
  "Review inputs/msa-acme.pdf. Produce redline + risk packet in outputs/."
```

You can also pin the model floor per agent by editing the `model` field in each `agents/*.md` frontmatter — useful if you want the redliner on opus for a high-stakes deal.

## FAQ

**Is this legal advice?**
No. It produces drafts. Every output must be reviewed by a qualified attorney before it is acted on or sent to a counterparty. The CLAUDE.md guardrails enforce this framing in every agent prompt.

**Where does my contract text go?**
Drop files into the local `inputs/` folder. The filesystem MCP server is scoped to that folder and `outputs/` — nothing leaves your machine except the model calls themselves. Use a redaction pass first if your matter requires it.

**Can I swap models or add an agent?**
Yes. Each agent is a standalone markdown file in `agents/`. Edit the `model:` frontmatter to change tier, or copy an existing file to add a new role (e.g. a `precedent-finder` agent). Re-run `harness validate` after.
